title: Getting Started with React-Native
---

I’ve decided to build my own mobile apps using React-Native even though i’ve never using React-Native before. So, the first thing that I did is looking for how to getting started with React-Native Development on Mac in the official site of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React-Native</a>.

To install React-Native on my system, the first thing that i need to do is installing node and watchman via <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>. I found so many problem during the installation process and the problem that I got often is linking step did not complete successfully. But I can solved every problem after looking for the possible way to solved my problem in <a href="https://www.google.co.id/">Google</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">Gitlab</a>, etc.


Next, I installed React-Native using NPM and Android SDK. The annoying problem that I’ve found is my internet connection is too slow to install Android SDK. I was testing my React-Native installation after all of the installation process has been successfully completed. I created a new React-Native project and run it but I found problem with my Android SDK. Like my project can’t found my Android SDK location, I haven’t install Android API 23, my phone can’t connect to developmet server, etc. my phone can’t connect to development serveris the problem that I got often. But finally I can solved it after setup debug server host and port on my phone.

6 hours later, and then this is my very first React-Native Apps. . . .

I have no idea if someone ask me what the advantage using React-Native because I’m a very newbie react native user and I need a lot of time to learn React-Native to find the answer.
